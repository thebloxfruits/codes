## New Regulations Propose Limiting Rewards and Capping Deposits

China has delivered a major blow to its massive online gaming industry with its newly proposed regulations aimed at curbing excessive spending within games. The draft rules under review suggest limiting rewards that incentivize repeated spending as well as capping how much money users can deposit each day or month.

If implemented, the changes would have wide-ranging impacts across China's games market as well as the fortunes of industry giants like Tencent and NetEase. Stocks in these companies plummeted when the new policies were announced as investors fretted over reduced monetization opportunities going forward.
However, Beijing insists the regulations are needed to foster a healthier environment for both players and businesses over the long run. Promoting responsible habits among users, especially minors, remains a key government priority even as economic concerns swirl.

### The Proposed Regulations

On December 22, China's National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA) unveiled the draft rules covering oversight of online games. A public feedback period is currently underway.

Of particular focus are proposals to:

- Limit in-game rewards that incentivize repetitive spending like daily login bonuses or bonuses for initial or continued deposits.

- Prohibit game operators from enabling in-app purchases of high-priced "virtual" goods through activities like auctions.

- Require deposit caps for users and warning messages about irrational expenditure.

- Bar minors from gifting money to livestreamers and restrict their own daily/monthly budgets based on age.

- Ensure protection of personal data and national security interests.

The draft rules emphasize guidance rather than enforcement as their goal for now. However, failures to comply could potentially draw regulatory penalties in the future.

### Market Panic and Debate

Investor panic was swift, with Tencent shares plummeting over 12% the day of the announcement in Hong Kong. Its market value dropped $47 billion, while rival NetEase sank 25% in its worst single-day performance.

Other entertainment and video firms reliant on gaming, such as Bilibili and Kuaishou, also witnessed sharp declines. The collective losses demonstrate gaming's outsized importance to China's booming internet sector.

Debate around the provisions' impacts remains heated inside the industry as well. While some worry about reduced monetization models, others see Beijing continuing its progressive oversight of the landscape. Uncertainties linger around what changes may ultimately materialize as feedback is reviewed.

For players, clearer guardrails could help curb impulse spending habits. However, limits on deposit amounts may dampen engagement from financially disciplined spenders. Balancing these considerations will be crucial for regulations to gain acceptance.

Over time, Tencent expressed belief that the draft leaves core business mechanics and growth pace largely intact. But compliance will demand adaptations, particularly in promotion and lifecycle support. How any finalized rules are implemented and enforced will dictate their true effects.

## Conclusion

China shows no sign of letting up in its drive to ensure gaming remains healthy, responsible and aligned with broader socio-economic goals. Its latest proposed restrictions again display the sector's vulnerability amid shifting regulatory goals.

Still, with modifications possible, the final policy outlook is still unknown. And China's sheer market size means operators will adjust models to preserve access, not exit. Continued oversight remains inevitable, though, as player welfare rises up governments' agendas globally.

How industries and regulators find common ground balancing interests will set precedents for others worldwide. The evolving policies in China and subsequent impacts will thus be closely watched by all with stakes in digital entertainment.
