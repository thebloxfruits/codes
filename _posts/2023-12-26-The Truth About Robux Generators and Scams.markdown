### How 'Free' Robux Generators Really Work

There is no such thing as a legit free Robux generator. Any website or person claiming to offer free Robux is scamming you. These scams are designed to steal your personal information like your Roblox password or credit card number. They may also infect your computer with malware. 

Robux generators that ask you to complete surveys and other offers are not actually giving you Robux. Once you "complete human verification", the generator leads you to websites with impossible surveys. The goal is to keep you doing offers forever without receiving any Robux. By doing this, the scammers earn money from the survey sites. 

Some generators may seem legit because they don't ask for your password. But they are still scams that waste your time without paying out. No matter what a generator promises, there is no real way to get free Robux. Any Robux you see added to your account did not actually come from the generator - it is just a fake number to trick you.

### How YouTubers and Ads Spread Generator Scams

You may see ads or YouTubers promoting Robux generators. But often these are just another part of the scam. The generator sites pay YouTubers and use ad budgets to reach more potential victims. 

In generator ad comments, you'll usually see bots praising the site and claiming it works. This is intended to trick people into thinking the generator is trustworthy. In reality, these positive commenters are automated accounts controlled by the scammers. 

Some YouTubers directly clickbait their fans into scam sites for money too. They pretend a generator or giveaway will get subscribers free Robux if they like and comment. But it's all a show to drive views and scam victims.

No YouTuber or ad is really giving away Robux. They are accomplices of the generator scams, using their audience's trust to spread lies and profit from others' losses. Don't be fooled - your favorite creators are not your friends when it comes to 'free' currency claims.

### The Only Legit Ways to Get Robux

To get Robux legitimately, you have two main options supported by Roblox:

1. Purchase Robux directly from the Roblox site or app. This is the only way to ensure you get real Robux added to your account.

2. Earn Robux by creating items, games or other contributions that are sold in the Roblox catalog. Successful creators can earn small amounts through this method over time with hard work and skill. 

Giveaways hosted by Roblox themselves may also provide occasional opportunities to win a limited amount of Robux. But do your research to avoid entering fake contests as well.

In summary, free Robux does not exist - but spending money directly on Robux or creating valuable content are supported paths built into how Roblox is designed to work. Stay safe by distrusting all 'too good to be true' generator claims and trusting only official Roblox systems. Now go unlock some real fun through creative effort instead of empty scams!
