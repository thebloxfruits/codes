### Texas Bowl Prediction
The Texas A&M Aggies will defeat the Oklahoma State Cowboys 31-27 in a close game played at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas on December 27. While both teams feature high-powered offenses, the Aggies will have just enough to pull out the victory. Texas A&M quarterback Haynes King will throw for over 300 yards and 3 touchdowns. Aggies running back Devon Achane will rush for over 100 yards and a score. Oklahoma State will struggle to contain both King and Achane, which will be the difference in the outcome.

### Gator Bowl Prediction
The Gator Bowl matchup between Clemson and Kentucky will be tightly contested, but the Tigers will emerge victorious 24-14. Clemson quarterback DJ Uiagalelei will bounce back from an up-and-down season with a strong showing against the Wildcats. He will throw for over 250 yards and 2 touchdowns. Clemson running back Will Shipley will add over 100 yards on the ground. While Kentucky will manage to score twice, their offense led by quarterback Will Levis will be held mostly in check by the ferocious Clemson defense. Clemson will ride the momentum of a strong defensive performance to the win.

### Cotton Bowl Prediction
In a battle of Big Ten and SEC powers, Ohio State will narrowly defeat Missouri 24-20 in the Cotton Bowl. Missouri quarterback Brady Cook and running back Cody Schrader will keep the game close with big plays on offense. However, Ohio State running back TreVeyon Henderson will eclipse the 100-yard mark and score twice, including the go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter. Ohio State quarterback Kyle McCord will effectively manage the game in place of the injured C.J. Stroud. The Buckeyes defense will make just enough stops down the stretch to secure the victory.

### Peach Bowl Prediction
The Peach Bowl matchup between Penn State and Ole Miss will be an exciting offensive showcase. However, Penn State will come out on top 24-17. Penn State quarterback Sean Clifford will toss 3 touchdowns in another accurate and productive outing. Meanwhile, the Nittany Lions defense will do just enough to slow down Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart and the Rebels attack. Ole Miss will score a pair of touchdowns but will come up short late as Penn State holds on for the win.

### Music City Bowl Prediction
In a close, hard-fought Music City Bowl, the Maryland Terrapins will defeat the Auburn Tigers 20-17. Maryland quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa will lead an efficient passing attack, throwing for over 250 yards and a pair of scores. Meanwhile, the Terrapins defense will bottle up Auburn running back Tank Bigsby and limit the Tigers offense, which has struggled at times this season. Maryland kicker Chad Ryland will drill a late field goal to give his team the narrow victory.

### Orange Bowl Prediction
The Orange Bowl will be a lopsided affair as the dominant Georgia Bulldogs roll to a 34-10 win over Florida State. Georgia quarterback Stetson Bennett will light up the Seminoles secondary, throwing for over 300 yards and 3 touchdowns. Meanwhile, the Bulldogs smothering defense will make life miserable for Florida State and their two new starting quarterbacks playing in place of Jordan Travis. Georgia will race out to a big early lead and coast to an easy victory.

### ReliaQuest Bowl Prediction
The LSU Tigers will use a dynamic offensive attack to defeat Wisconsin 38-24 in the ReliaQuest Bowl. LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels will showcase his big play ability, throwing for over 250 yards and 2 scores while adding 75 rushing yards. Tailbacks Armoni Goodwin and Noah Cain will each top 100 rushing yards and score a touchdown. Meanwhile, the Tigers defense will bounce back from a down year with 3 interceptions of Wisconsin quarterback Graham Mertz. LSU will pull away late and celebrate their first post-Brian Kelly victory.

### Citrus Bowl Prediction
In a close battle between SEC and Big Ten powers, the Tennessee Volunteers will emerge victorious 17-10 over Iowa in the Citrus Bowl. Tennessee quarterback Hendon Hooker will stake the Vols to an early lead with a pair of first half touchdown strikes. Iowa will manage one touchdown but struggle to consistently move the ball against the Volunteers stingy defense. Tennessee will add a late insurance field goal before slamming the door on Iowa to complete the victory.

### Rose Bowl Prediction
Despite entering as underdogs, the powerful Alabama Crimson Tide will defeat Michigan 30-17 in the Rose Bowl semifinal. Alabama quarterback Bryce Young will shred the Michigan secondary for over 350 yards and 3 touchdowns in a Heisman-worthy performance. Meanwhile, Crimson Tide running back Jahmyr Gibbs will add over 100 scrimmage yards. Michigan will manage a pair of touchdowns but their offense will be held in check for much of the game by the menacing Alabama defense. The Tide will roll to yet another College Football Playoff victory.

### National Championship Prediction
In a highly anticipated title game rematch, the Alabama Crimson Tide will defeat the Texas Longhorns 30-24 to claim another National Championship. Alabama QB Bryce Young will continue his masterful playoff run by throwing for over 400 yards and 3 more touchdowns. However, it will take a late defensive stop by the Tide to prevent Texas and QB Quinn Ewers from mounting a game-tying drive. Alabama running back Jahmyr Gibbs will ice the game with a backbreaking 50-yard touchdown scamper. The Crimson Tide will cut down the nets in Houston, clinching Saban's eighth career national title.
