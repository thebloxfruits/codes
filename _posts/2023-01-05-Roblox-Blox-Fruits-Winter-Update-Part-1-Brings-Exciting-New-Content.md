After much anticipation, [Roblox Blox Fruits](https://thebloxfruits.github.io/codes/roblox/2023/12/27/Seven-Proven-Strategies-to-Maximize-Your-Candy-Gains-in-Blox-Fruits.html) welcomed Update 21 with a special Christmas event: Winter Update Part 1. This update introduced a new fruit, subclass, event challenges, limited edition accessories, and discounted bundles. The latest Mythical Blox Fruit, T-Rex debuted in the Winter Update Part 1. This fruit costs 2,700,000 Beli or 2350 Robux from the in-game NPC trader. Here is the moveset of T-Rrex Fruit:
- Prey Mark (Passive)
- Claw Slashes
- Tail Swipe
- Predatory Screech
- Hunter's Rage
- Reptilian Scales
- Gigantic Leap
- Transformation

Players who consume T-Rex Fruit can also transform into a giant T-Rex and inflict bleed damage.

### Candies Event Challenges

The Winter Update Part 1 Event tasks players with defeating enemies on the island to obtain Candies. These Candies can then be traded with NPC Elves to earn in-game resources such as Fragments, Exp Boosters, Stat Refund, Race Reroll, Elf Hat, Santa Hat, and Sleigh.

The NPC Elves are located in the middle of the map and are identified with a white question mark and "MISC." floating above their heads. Players can start the special Candy Cane Quest after interacting with the Candy Cane Quest Giver NPC. Additionally, every player will receive a free Blox Fruit for every hour they spend on the map.

### Shipwright NPC Upgrades

The update also introduced an NPC Shipwright Teacher. Players can interact with this NPC to get repair buffs such as Repair, Plank Scavenger, Expert Repair, Repair Max Health, and No Stun Repair. The Shipwright Teacher will assign players the challenge of killing 20 Sharks on the map before granting access to the upgrade UI.

### Discounted Bundles

Currently, Beast and Holiday Bundles are up for grabs at discounted prices in the Roblox Blox Fruits game. The Beast Bundle, originally 10,700 Robux, is now 5999 Robux and includes Kitsune, T-Rex, and Mammoth Blox Fruits. The Holiday Bundle, originally 5650 Robux, is now 2999 Robux and contains Buddha and Portal Blox Fruits. Both bundles also offer 1,800,000 Beli and 10,000 Fragments.

The Winter Update Part 1 brought a host of new exciting content to Roblox Blox Fruits including the debut of the T-Rex fruit, event challenges, NPC interactions, and discounted bundles. Players can enjoy all these new additions while awaiting the release of Winter Update Part 2, which is expected to arrive before the new year with even more rewards and reworks.
