### Paul Onuachu Relaunching his Career in Turkey After Southampton Failure

Burnley have picked up an important win in the Premier League, and can still hope to turn things around in the second half of the season. To achieve that, Vincent Kompany has his eye on a former striker from the Belgian Pro League. 

Burnley are slowly improving their situation: the Clarets are no longer in last place in the Premier League after their away victory against Fulham (0-2). The next non-relegation place is now only 3 points away for Kompany's side, who can hope to use the January transfer window to bring in players that can help secure safety.

Meanwhile, Paul Onuachu is also doing better. After failing to make an impact at Southampton following his ú18 million move from Racing Genk last January, the 29-year-old Nigerian is on loan this season at Turkish club Trabzonspor. There, he is reviving his career with 8 goals in 13 Super Lig matches so far. Onuachu signed for Southampton as a highly-rated striker in Belgium, but wasn't able to find the net in his 12 appearances for the Saints.

Return to England in Style? 
Kompany, who of course knows Onuachu well from their time together in the Belgian Pro League, is reportedly eyeing a move to bring the striker back and give him a second chance in the Premier League. According to Turkish journalist Ekrem Konur, several English clubs including Burnley are closely monitoring Onuachu's situation. The 2021 Belgian Golden Shoe winner, who scored 85 goals in 134 games for Genk, is still valued at around ú13 million on Transfermarkt. 

After failing to adapt to life in England the first time around, Onuachu gets a chance to revive his career and reputation on loan in Turkey. His solid form with 8 goals so far for Trabzonspor will certainly be turning some heads. With his proven track record in front of goal in Belgium's top division, the physical striker could be an important target man option for Vincent Kompany as he looks to strengthen Burnley in their fight against relegation. Kompany's understanding of Onuachu's game from their days together at Genk makes this link an obvious one. A return to England and a Premier League comeback with Burnley could be on the cards if Onuachu's revival continues in the coming months.
