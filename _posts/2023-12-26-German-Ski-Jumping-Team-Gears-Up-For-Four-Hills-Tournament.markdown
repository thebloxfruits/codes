## The lineup for the opening event in Oberstdorf

As the 72nd edition of the prestigious Four Hills Tournament kicks off, the German Ski Jumping team finds itself with only 5 starting spots available for the opening event in Oberstdorf. Head coach Stefan Horngacher is relying on athletes who have competed in World Cup events already this season, and will receive reinforcements after the New YearÆs competition. 

As the German Ski Federation (DSV) has now officially confirmed, Horngacher will field the same lineup for Oberstdorf that has been seen recently in World Cup competition. The coach must leave one athlete out of his squad, as Germany now has only 5 starting spots instead of the recent 6. 

ôAfter a successful and high-performing start to the season, we look forward to the Tournament with confidence. We want to stay focused and concentrated, and be present from the very first competition. At the same time, we know from experience in recent years that we cannot force anything at the Tournament - even if our previous performances were good,ö said Horngacher before departing for Oberstdorf.

Horngacher will continue to rely on Andreas Wellinger, Karl Geiger, Pius Paschke, Stephan Leyhe and Philipp Raimund. "Four of these athletes have stood on the podium in the current season, with Karl Geiger and Pius Paschke having won World Cups. The team spirit is strong, the athletes push each other and are happy for each other's successes," said the head coach. Martin Hamann, meanwhile, is no longer part of the team as expected, having lost his World Cup starting spot due to a recent downward trend in form. 

## National group to debut at the New Year's competition

As in the previous two years, Germany will initially forego fielding its so-called national group in addition to the World Cup team at the Oberstdorf opening event. The additional quota available to the federation for two home World Cups per season will first be used at the traditional New Year's competition in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.

Until then, Markus Eisenbichler also still has to worry about making his first World Cup appearance of the season - as Germany will only have four additional starting spots instead of the recent six available in Garmisch. The multiple World Champion Eisenbichler has not been convincing recently in the Continental Cup, currently lying in 20th place in the overall standings as the fourth strongest German ski jumper after four competitions. 

A final decision on allocating the remaining spots will be made after the Continental Cup in Engelberg, Switzerland, which takes place parallel to the Tournament opening in Engelberg.

## Horngacher sees expanded circle of favorites 

Considering the recent World Cups, head coach Stefan Horngacher does not expect an exclusively German-Austrian duel for the overall Tournament victory. "In addition to the top jumpers from Austria and Germany, athletes from Japan, Switzerland and occasionally Slovenia and Norway have closed the gap. I also assume that the Polish ski jumpers will present themselves in stronger form for the Tournament. As in recent years, the favorite circle again encompasses around ten jumpers," Horngacher said on the second Christmas holiday.
