### Thirsty Suitors
It's been a surreal year for video games, with publishers cutting jobs by the thousands and shuttering countless studios while boasting business has never been better. This cognitive dissonance leaves a bitter aftertaste. But the best games of 2023 are undeniable, including Outerloop Games' Thirsty Suitors. This eight-hour story about a woman named Jala returning to her hometown to sort through failed relationships is a breath of fresh air. Whatever's in the air that caused Bryan Lee O'Malley's Scott Pilgrim comic to reboot by healing trauma, bears fruit here. Battling Jala's exes draws the player into dreamlike inscapes with mythical stakes, animals, and songs.

### Jedi: Survivor
Against expectations, EA's Jedi: Survivor was Brian Tallerico's favorite Star Wars product in years. He has little interest in Disney+ shows outside of Andor but couldn't get enough of this game's world. Its open landscapes feel like they hold secrets, upgrades and characters around every corner. As his Jedi grew more powerful, he grew more addicted to seeing where the story went, until a familiar face advanced the game to his list. If the Jedi games continue with this entertaining escapism quality, maybe he can become a big Star Wars fan after all. 

### Starfield
After making the PC leap, Alex James Kane spent over 50 hours with Starfield between the main story and odd jobs. While it has weaknesses with so many explorable planets, if you approach it as a space exploration sim with Fallout scavenging, satisfying gunplay and similarities to Skyrim, there's plenty to marvel at. Particularly charming is the reverence for old Earth artifacts and Earth itself, treated like a late family member everyone's still mourning.

### Resident Evil 4
Including a 2005 game on a best of 2023 list is odd, but the Resident Evil 4 remake was Brian Tallerico's most enjoyable shooter of the year. The developers didn't just slap paint on one of his favorite games - they somehow made it better. When asked his best games of all time, Resident Evil 4 often comes first, and he says the 2023 version is even better. Updating gameplay to meet modern expectations without losing essence, the team found the perfect survival horror and action balance. He loves the RE franchise but this game did it best. 

### The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
The time Alex James Kane spent with Tears of the Kingdom was awe-inspiring artistically and technically. Yet it's so dense with puzzles and crafting that he still has a long way to go. If Breath of the Wild cut the open-world formula to its essence, Tears refuses comfort with that template through maximalism. He also enjoyed Mario Bros. Wonder though just started it, and the intimidating yet astonishing Baldur's Gate 3. A third of his Steam time was spent in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III's multiplayer too. Jedi: Survivor and Texas Chain Saw Massacre also impressed along with urban fantasy shooter El Paso, Elsewhere about a doomed romance resembling Armageddon.

### Alan Wake II 
Brian Tallerico can't stop thinking about Alan Wake II, designed to haunt gamers through an expertly realized mission. It's reminiscent of Twin Peaks: The Return not just for relaunching a dead property but by warping and questioning reality. Playing an investigator who may be the fictional creation of writer Alan Wake stuck in an alternate reality since the first game, he's unleashed a fiery alter ego on the world. The ambitious narrative allows playgrounds with gaming foundations, including an unreal live-action chapter. It was breathtaking with nothing else like it in gaming or elsewhere this year.

###  Best Combat
Capcom's Resident Evil 4 remake set a high bar for third-person combat, but the graceful and responsive fighting in FromSoftware's Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon sets a new standard. Its combat feels carefully authored to highlight player expression through mech construction and playstyle. Despite frenetic fights, you never feel out of control thanks to Armored Core VI's constant responsiveness around player intent.

###  Best Original Score  
Pulling emotion from both explosive boss fights and quiet hideaway moments, Final Fantasy XVI's soundtrack exceeded expectations. Composers Masayoshi Soken, Ramin Djawadi and other talented artists crafted music enhancing the game's best parts. We'll be humming these tracks for years to come.

###  Best Hero
As Valisthea's lodestar, Clive Rosfield guides players through the complex world of Final Fantasy XVI. His engaging backstory and passionate performance by Ben Starr set him apart from other brooding protagonists. Clive beautifully fills the role of guiding audiences through the gripping setting.

###  Best Villain
In Tears of the Kingdom, Ganondorf makes his most formidable appearance yet against Link. For the first time, he's fully voiced and depicted in an immortal, dehydrated form scarier than ever before. His climactic battle may be fans' favorite Ganondorf fight yet in this long-running series.
