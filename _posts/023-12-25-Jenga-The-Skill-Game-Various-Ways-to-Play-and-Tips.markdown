### What is Jenga? The Origin of the Game

The game known as Jenga originated in Africa. The name Jenga comes from the Swahili verb "kujenga", which means "to build". Jenga began gaining popularity worldwide in the 1980s when Hasbro began marketing and distributing the game.

In Jenga, players take turns slowly removing one block at a time from a tower constructed of three-dimensional blocks stacked on top of one another in various formations, and placing it at the top of the tower, creating a slightly taller but less stable structure. The aim of the game is to remove and replace the blocks without causing the tower to fall. It tests concentration, fine motor skills and patience.

A standard Jenga set contains 54 wooden blocks. There are also variations like numbered Jenga, colored Jenga, Uno Jenga and love Jenga that utilize blocks with numbers, colors or messages.

### Numbered Jenga Rules

Numbered Jenga is one of the classic and most basic ways to play. Here are some common numbered Jenga rules:

**Even/Odd:** Players roll a die before removing a block. Odd numbers pick an odd numbered block, even numbers an even block.

**Layered:** The tower is divided into two zones. 1-3 on the die picks a top block, 4-6 a bottom block.

**Point Value:** Corresponds the die roll to a range of block numbers (e.g. 1=1-10, 2=11-20).

### Uno Jenga Rules

Uno Jenga adds a fun twist by combining rules from the card game Uno. In addition to color and number, blocks have symbols mimicking Uno cards like Draw Two and Skip. Players must match the block color, number or symbol of the previous player or play a Wild card. Special blocks also have Uno-like effects on other players. This variation significantly increases the challenge.

### Tips for Playing Jenga

- Slowly and carefully remove blocks, making sure the tower does not tilt or lean at any point.
- Count blocks so the tower remains balanced when replacing. Move quickly to regain stability.
- Use two hands when possible for added control during placement.
- Focus and breathe steady to keep hands from shaking on critical turns.
- Encourage others and have fun! Jenga brings people together through friendly competition.

Overall, Jenga is a great game for all ages that exercises dexterity while providing light-hearted fun. I hope these rules and tips help you fully unlock the thrill of the game!
